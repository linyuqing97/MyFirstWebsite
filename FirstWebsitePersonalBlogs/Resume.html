      <p>I am a junior conputer science student in Binghamton university. I was born in China and came to the states almost five year ago.I was greaduate at LaGuardia Community College and continue working toward my bachelos in computer science.like most people in this field,I like video game.When I was 8, I met my first video game. Then I
        I found myself fell into the video game world or this incredible internet world and start curious how they work etc. By the time I greaduated from my high school, I chosses computer science as my future career with no doubt. </p>
